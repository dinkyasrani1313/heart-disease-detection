# heart-disease-detection
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.


Attribute Information:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

Here we use Logistic Regression, decission tree and random forest to identify whether a person has a heart disease or not

**conclusion**


Accuracy achieved: 90% (Random Forest)
